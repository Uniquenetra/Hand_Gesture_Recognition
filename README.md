# Hand_Gesture_Recognition

## C. Approach Overview

Our approach to hand gesture recognition involves utilizing a deep learning model based on multi-channel deep convolutional neural networks (MC-DCNN). This approach can be divided into three main stages:

### Hand Gesture Capture
This stage involves segmenting the hand region using depth and color information, resulting in a 3D sequence representing the hand gesture.

### Feature Extraction
Features and parameters are estimated from the 3D sequence inputs. This stage plays a crucial role in preparing the data for classification.

### Gesture Recognition or Classification
The focus of this study lies in the classification stage, where features extracted from hand-skeletal data are used as inputs to a deep learning model to classify them into known labels.

In the Capture stage, most models utilize RGB-D image sequences, but our approach utilizes hand skeletal data sequences, which allows for quicker processing.

Feature extraction can be achieved through explicit hand-crafted features or implicit feature learning using deep learning algorithms. While deep learning algorithms implicitly learn features that often better describe the data, they may suffer from drawbacks such as overfitting and lack of generalization to unseen data.

The skeletal data consists of a sequence of 22 points representing hand-skeleton joints, where each joint represents a distinct articulation or part of the hand.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) process data through layers that perform convolution, pooling, and output dense layers. To effectively learn features, CNNs require a large volume of training data. Transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques are commonly employed to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks or datasets.

Incorporating external expert knowledge can lead to the use of simpler models or pre-processing techniques tailored to the specific task. For example, input data can be pre-processed to emphasize important features known to domain experts.

Sequence data exhibit time-domain dependencies, requiring specialized models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. However, in this study, we propose a convolution-based architecture called Multi-channel Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (MC-DCNN), which does not use recurrent cells or attention mechanisms. MC-DCNNs process parallel unidimensional sequences and perform feature learning on each univariate sequence individually. This architecture is well-suited for skeleton data and offers advantages over other models by being agnostic to the skeleton's structure.

Overall, our approach combines deep learning techniques with specialized architectures tailored to the unique characteristics of hand gesture recognition tasks.

### Equations:

#### Centroid Calculation:
\[ \mathbf{C} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} \mathbf{x}_i}{k} \]

Where:
- \(\mathbf{C}\) is the centroid of the set of points.
- \(\mathbf{x}_i\) are the individual points in the set.
- \(k\) is the number of points in the set.

#### Sequence Data Representation:
\[ \mathbf{s} = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n)^T \]
\[ p_i = (x(i), y(i), z(i)) \quad \text{for} \quad t \in \mathbb{R} \]

Where:
- \(\mathbf{s}\) represents the sequence data of hand-skeletal joints.
- \(p_i\) represents a specific skeletal joint.
- \(x(i), y(i), z(i)\) are the three components representing the position of the \(i\)-th skeletal joint.
