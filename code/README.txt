# Deep Learning for Hand Gesture Recognition

Follow the next steps to be able to run this project correctly.

# Installation

First of all, create a new environment.

    conda create --name mp_env


Then, activate the environment.

    conda activate mp_env


Lastly, use the package manager pip to install mediapipe.

    pip install mediapipe


# Usage

Run the capture_hand.py file to, using your laptop camera, capture the hand gesture you want to use.

    python capture_hand.py


Run the generate_new_dataset.py file to be able to generate the new dataset.

    python generate_new_dataset.py


Run the Deep_Learning_for_Hand_Recognition.ipynb using the new dataset recently generated, following the steps described there.
